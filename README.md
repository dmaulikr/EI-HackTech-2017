# EI-HackTech-2017
EI (Emotional Intelligence) is an IOS app that uses Microsoft's Emotion API to analyze information about emotion from a picture and gives insight about mood of the person. Along with the mood, the app suggest jokes, songs, articles to the person. It also has ability to call 911 or other emergency number if it senses your fear.

The demo of the app is available [here](https://devpost.com/software/ei).
